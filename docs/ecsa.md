# Steps to run
## 1. Select ECSA files
Drag-and-drop or click to upload your data files.
The file names should appear as new rows in the table and the data should be displayed in the "ECSA: Double-layer capacitance" plot.
However, for the plot to work properly, you must **edit the table to specify the scan rate** for the run and the desired cycle number.

TODO: ADD FORMAT REQUIREMENTS.

## 2. Specify input parameters
Select values for the input parameters.
TODO: ADD PARAMETER DESCRIPTIONS.


# Required data format
For the current application version, the ESCA data files must have the following format.
The first column is the potential (Ewe) in V.
The second column is the current (I) in mA.
The third column is the cycle number.
The first row is ignored as it contains header information.


# Overview
The potentials and currents for the selected cycle are plotted for all scan rates.
